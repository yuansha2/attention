RPP model for citation prediction.
"test.txt" is the input file. Each line contains the information of a paper. The first number is the time that need to predict. The other numbers are the cited time in an increasing order. The time is counted by day.
Run "main.exe" can get a new file called "a.txt". It contains the results of the prediction. The number in the i-th line is the prediction of total citations until the time that need to predict.
